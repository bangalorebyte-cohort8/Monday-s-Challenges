**Challenge #1:**
ROT13 is a weak form of encryption that involves “rotating” each letter in a word
by 13 places. To rotate a letter means to shift it through the alphabet, wrapping around to the
beginning if necessary, so ’A’ shifted by 3 is ’D’ and ’Z’ shifted by 1 is ’A’.
Write a function called rotate_word that takes a string and an integer as parameters, and that
returns a new string that contains the letters from the original string “rotated” by the given amount.
For example, “cheer” rotated by 7 is “jolly” and “melon” rotated by -10 is “cubed”.
You might want to use the built-in functions ord, which converts a character to a numeric code,
and chr, which converts numeric codes to characters"""

**Challenge #2:**
Two words are “rotate pairs” if you can rotate one of them and get the other (see above problem)
Write a program that reads a wordlist and finds all the rotate pairs. Hint: Use a dictionary"""

**Challenge #3:**
Write a function called most_frequent that takes a string and prints the letters
in decreasing order of frequency. Hint: Use a tuple
